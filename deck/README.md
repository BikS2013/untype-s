# untype technical deck

A 53-slide HTML presentation about untype (what it is, how it works, installation, configuration, operation), built with the `nbg-design` skill on its **BikS2013 theme** (ink and copper on warm paper, Avenir Next, the BikS2013 wheel lockups) and decorated with photorealistic images generated for this purpose in the same palette.

**Live deck (HTML):** https://biks2013.github.io/untype-s/ — published automatically by GitHub Pages, see [Publishing](#publishing-github-pages).

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `untype-deck.html` | The self-contained deck (all images embedded). Open in any browser; arrow keys or the on-screen buttons navigate. Right-click for the in-deck menu (edit text, resize shapes, export to PDF, save an edited copy). |
| `untype-deck.pdf` | One page per slide, exported from the HTML with the skill's exporter. |
| `untype-deck.rebuild.mjs` | Re-embeds the newest version of the in-deck editing tools after the nbg-design skill is updated (`node untype-deck.rebuild.mjs --check` reports, without `--check` it rebuilds and re-exports the PDF). |

## Sources and how to rebuild

- `src/shell-head.html`, `src/slides.html`, `src/shell-tail.html`: the deck source, authored with `{{TOKEN}}` image placeholders.
- `images/generate-images.sh`: generates the photo set with `image-tool` (Azure OpenAI `gpt-image-2`) in the BikS2013 palette (charcoal ink, copper and amber accents, cream and paper surfaces; nothing teal). Existing PNGs are skipped, so delete a file to regenerate it. Prompts live in the script.
- `images/make-datauris.sh`: converts every PNG to a 1600 px JPEG and writes `assets/<name>.datauri.txt`, the form the embedder consumes. `assets/logo-*.datauri.txt` are the BikS2013 lockups, copied from the skill's `BikS2013-Design/assets/`.
- `build.sh`: concatenates the sources, embeds the assets, inlines the deck menu with `--theme biks2013` (copper toolbars, the assistant briefed on the BikS2013 system), runs the strict verifier, writes the rebuild script and exports the PDF. Requires the `nbg-design` plugin 1.20.0 or newer (path overridable with `NBG_DESIGN_SKILL`) and Chrome for the PDF.

```
./images/generate-images.sh   # only when images must be (re)generated
./images/make-datauris.sh
./build.sh                    # or ./build.sh --no-pdf
```

`untype-deck.src.html` is an intermediate file produced by the build.

## Publishing (GitHub Pages)

The HTML deck is published at **https://biks2013.github.io/untype-s/** by the workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-deck.yml` (on the `deck` branch). Every push to `deck` that touches anything under `deck/` (or the workflow itself) rebuilds `untype-deck.html` from the sources (`./build.sh --no-pdf`) and deploys it as the site's `index.html`; the workflow can also be started by hand from the Actions tab (*Run workflow*). The PDF is not rebuilt by the workflow.

The workflow does not have the `nbg-design` plugin, so it builds with `tools/nbg-design/`, a vendored copy of the plugin's `scripts/` folder (`tools/nbg-design/plugin.json` records the version). After updating the plugin locally, run `tools/sync-nbg-design.sh` and commit the result so the published deck carries the newer editing tools.

Repository settings the workflow relies on (already applied): Pages source = *GitHub Actions*; the `github-pages` environment allows deployments from the `deck` branch in addition to `main`.
