# Verification Report: Swift Drop-In Replacement

## Provenance
- Refined request: `/Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s/docs/reference/refined-request-swift-drop-in-replacement.md`
- Implementation plan: `/Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s/docs/design/plan-001-swift-drop-in-replacement.md`
- Compatibility checklist: `/Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s/docs/reference/compatibility-checklist-swift-drop-in-replacement.md`
- Pending items: `/Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s/Issues - Pending Items.md`

## Current Verdict
The Swift implementation is not yet approved as a full drop-in replacement for the TypeScript `untype` command.

The automated implementation surface is broad and currently passing, but final replacement remains blocked by live macOS/provider verification, final UI polish, and distribution planning for signed/notarized UI delivery.

## Verified Automatically
- SwiftPM executable product `untype` builds successfully.
- `swift test` passes with 105 Swift Testing tests.
- CLI help/version, config precedence, missing/invalid config errors, `.env` edge cases, legacy config-folder migration detection, expiry warnings, renderer modes, protocol state, JSONL event sequencing, provider adapters, LLM refiners, focused-input privacy, UI settings persistence, UI startup config-chain loading, transient UI permission status privacy, grouped UI transcript timeline behavior, and push-to-talk silence gating are covered by automated tests.
- Native UI active-session editability is covered by automated tests: session-shaping controls are disabled while a session is active, while protocol operator switches stay editable.
- UI microphone activity feedback is covered by runtime tests for normal and gate-muted PCM activity snapshots.

## Manual Verification Still Required
- Run `test_scripts/microphone-live-smoke.md` on a target macOS host.
- Run `test_scripts/soniox-live-smoke.md` with a real Soniox credential.
- Run `test_scripts/elevenlabs-live-smoke.md` with a real ElevenLabs credential.
- Run `test_scripts/focused-input-smoke.md` with Accessibility permission paths verified.
- Run `test_scripts/ui-mode-smoke.md` to verify native UI launch, push-to-talk release detection, overlay focus behavior, warm session recycling, and secret-free persistence.

## Replacement Blockers
- Live microphone/provider/macOS permission smoke tests have not been executed.
- `untype ui` needs final visual polish and live Accessibility/Input Monitoring verification.
- Distribution remains local Swift executable first; signed/notarized app bundle and Homebrew-style packaging are unresolved.

## Last Automated Verification
- `swift build`: passed on 2026-05-24.
- `swift test`: passed on 2026-05-24 with 105 tests.
