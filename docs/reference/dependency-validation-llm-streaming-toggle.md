# Dependency Validation — untype-s (LLM Streaming Toggle)

## 1. Summary

This project is a macOS Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) project (`Package.swift`, swift-tools-version 6.0). The dependency validation agent supports npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, uv, poetry, pipenv, and pip ecosystems only — SwiftPM is not in the supported set. No supported lockfile or manifest (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lock, uv.lock, poetry.lock, Pipfile.lock, requirements.txt) was found in the project root. Status is `skipped_no_manifest` per the workflow specification: this is not an error condition.

The project's `Package.swift` was inspected manually. It declares **zero third-party dependencies** — all targets depend only on each other and on Apple platform SDKs (Foundation, AVFoundation, AppKit, etc.). The recently-implemented LLM streaming feature confirmed in the refined request at `docs/reference/refined-request-llm-streaming-toggle.md` uses only `URLSession.bytes(for:)` and `AsyncThrowingStream`, both part of Foundation, introducing no new third-party packages. The workspace-state snapshot at `.build/workspace-state.json` confirms the resolved dependency graph is empty (`"dependencies": []`).

## 2. Initial State

No third-party packages are declared or resolved in this project. The dependency tree is zero-node.

| Package | Current Version | Scope | Severity | Message |
|---------|----------------|-------|----------|---------|
| *(none)* | — | — | — | — |

## 3. Replacements Applied

No replacements were applied. There are no third-party packages to replace.

## 4. Manual Review Needed

**None.** The project has no third-party dependencies that require review.

However, the following ecosystem-level observation is documented for completeness:

- **SwiftPM not supported by this validation tool.** The project uses Apple's Swift Package Manager. The canonical way to audit SwiftPM dependencies for known vulnerabilities is via the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) advisory database or GitHub's dependency-graph / Dependabot feature (which does support `Package.swift` since 2022). Since this project has zero external packages today, no advisory lookup is required at this time. If external SwiftPM packages are added in future, configure GitHub Dependabot alerts or run `swift package show-dependencies` followed by a manual advisory check against the Swift Package Index or GitHub Advisory Database.

## 5. Security Audit

Security audit was requested (`include_security_audit: true`) but could not be executed: no supported package manager audit command (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.) applies to a SwiftPM project. The project has zero third-party dependencies; there is no advisory surface to audit.

| Tool | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| `npm audit` | Not applicable — no `package.json` |
| `pip-audit` | Not applicable — no Python manifest |
| SwiftPM advisory scan | Not supported by this tool; zero packages to scan |

**Vulnerability count: 0** (vacuously — there are no dependencies to carry vulnerabilities).

## 6. Final State

The project is clean with respect to third-party dependency hygiene:

- Zero third-party packages declared in `Package.swift`.
- Zero transitive packages resolved (confirmed by `.build/workspace-state.json`: `"dependencies": []`).
- The LLM streaming feature added in the `llm-streaming-toggle` work uses only Apple Foundation APIs (`URLSession.bytes(for:)`, `AsyncThrowingStream`); no new external packages were introduced.
- No deprecated packages, no security advisories, no packages requiring replacement.

Status: **skipped_no_manifest** — no supported package-manager manifest detected; SwiftPM is out of scope for this tool. This is not an error; it reflects an intentionally zero-dependency project.

## 7. Commands Run

| # | Command | Exit Code | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | `ls /Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s/` | 0 | Confirmed project root exists; `Package.swift` present; no npm/pip/etc manifest found |
| 2 | `find /Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s -name "Package.resolved"` | 0 | No `Package.resolved` found (zero external packages — SwiftPM does not generate one when the graph is empty) |
| 3 | `cat /Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s/.build/workspace-state.json` | 0 | Confirmed `"dependencies": []` in resolved workspace state |
| 4 | `which swift && swift --version` | 0 | Swift 6.3.2 (swiftlang-6.3.2.1.108) confirmed available; SwiftPM not in supported ecosystem list — no install/outdated/audit commands run |
| 5 | `git -C /Users/giorgosmarinos/aiwork/coding-platform/untype-s rev-parse HEAD` | 0 | HEAD = `e70d4fb37cd9222b8bb1db2f6680d66e4e4c4320` |
